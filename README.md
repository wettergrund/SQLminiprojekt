üèó Things that could be improved

-   New names is formatted with upper first letter. But if user accidently enter nAme it will be formatted as NAme. 
    -   If all letters beyond first letter should be lower, it will create problem for people with double name, hence I left it helping user with first letter only.
-  Proper error handling if DB is down.
